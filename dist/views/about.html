I am an Open Source enthusiast who loves the Internet. I love to play with code and create things from it. I love to make applications for the web and desktop which are interesting. Programming is my hobby you can find me doing coding on codechef and on my friends laptop :) I am a great fan of Open Source Softwares and appreciate the open source community.
<br/>
In my free time you can find me watching Anime and reading books.
